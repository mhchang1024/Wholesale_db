* Name: Michael H Chang 
* Description: This semester-long project for my databases class, where I had to make a WHOLESALE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DATABASE. I chose the topic of what the database was supposed to be about regarding what items were sold with this inventory. I decided on rock climbing gear because I have years of experience using a wholesale management system database. The database was made using MySQL and raw SQL for the inserts and the business requirements. The end goal of this database for the class was to create a discord bot with python.
